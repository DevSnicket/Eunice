## Premise

DevSnicket Eunice is a system of utilities based on the premise that unidirectional dependencies can be beneficial to structure and modularity in software. Euince's approach isn't limited to direct dependencies, but includes indirect dependencies as well.

## Stacks

Part of how Eunince works is by defining stacks. When its indended that an item is to be dependent upon another item, the first item is placed above the second item in a stack. When items are indended to be independent of each other they can be placed at the same level in a stack.

In some programming languages there are implied stacks, such as the order of functions in a file.

## Scale

The approach of defining stacks can be applied at all scales of software and across boundaries, from individual files, functions or classes, to multiple, large codebases in different languages, frameworks and runtimes.

## Stages

## YAML

So Euince has composability, e.g. multiple sources of dependency and structure, a common data format is described using YAML.

``` YAML
- id: item in upper level of stack
  dependsUpon: first item in lower level of stack
  items:
  - id: nested item
    dependsUpon: second item in lower level of stack
-
  - first item in lower level of stack
  - second item in lower level of stack
```

## Analyzers

Analyzers are implemented to create the YAML files, one is currently in development for JavaScript analyzer.

## Processors

YAML files generated by analyzers can then be optionally post-processed which includes combining the output of different analyzers. Currently there are processors written in JavaScript to:
- [group items by their identifier](Processors/groupItemsByIdentifierSeparator)
- order items by
	- [identifier](Processors/orderItemsBy/identifier)
	- index of
		- [identifier suffix](Processors/orderItemsBy/indexOf/identifierSuffix)
		- [type](Processors/orderItemsBy/indexOf/type)
- [remove redundant prefix of parent identifier and separator](Processors/removeRedundantParentIdentifierPrefix)
- [remove self dependent items of a type](Processors/removeSelfDependentItemsOfType)
- [remove suffixes from identifiers](Processors/removeIdentifierSuffix)
- [sets the type of root items](Processors/setTypeOfRootItems)
- create or add to stacks
	- [applied uniformly](Processors/createOrAddToStacks/uniformly.js)
	- [using the file system (devsnicket.eunice.stack.yaml)](Processors/createOrAddToStacks/usingFileSystem) (not available in test harness)
- [unstack independent items](Processors/unstackIndependent)

Processors can be run from the command line and ([example](dogfooding/generate.sh)) from test harnesses through a [plug-in discovery](https://github.com/DevSnicket/plugin-discovery) system.

## Renderer

To visualise and explorer what's in the YAML files, and to statistically measure how well they match the intended structure, a SVG renderer has been implemented. The renderer doesn't use lines between items to show dependencies and instead marks items with counts for each dependency type:

- matches stack (green down arrow)
- does not match stack (red up arrow) 
- is not independent (red horizontal arrow).

Dependency counts appear for both sides of the dependency, the dependent item and the item depended upon. When there are multiple counts a summary of all counts is rendered at the bottom. <sup>[1]</sup>.

Dependencies within an item are also summarised and rendered inside the item box, below the identifer text.

Items and sub-item can also be opened by clicking/tapping on their box. Opening an item will show its contents and breadcrumb links for where it is in the hierarchy.
