# Eunice ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevSnicket/eunice-renderer/master/getSvgElementForYaml/createArrows/testcase.svg?sanitize=true) [![Gitter chat](https://badges.gitter.im/devsnicket-eunice/gitter.png)](https://gitter.im/devsnicket-eunice)

DevSnicket Eunice is based on the premise that unidirectional dependencies can be beneficial to structure and modularity in software. Eunice's approach isn't limited to direct dependencies, but includes indirect dependencies as well.

## Stacks

Fundamental to Eunice is the act of defining stacks. When it's intended that an item is to be dependent upon another item, the first item is placed above the second item in a stack. When items are intended to be independent of each other they can be placed at the same level in a stack.

In some programming languages there are implied stacks, such as the order of functions in a file or the order of files in a project.

## Scale

The approach of defining stacks can be applied at all scales of software and across boundaries, from individual files, functions or classes, to multiple, large codebases in different languages, frameworks and runtimes.

## Stages

Eunice includes the stages shown below. Transitions are made between the stages using YAML. An explanation of the YAML and stages follows.

## YAML

To give Eunice [composability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composability) within and between stages, a common data format for structure and dependency is described using [YAML](https://yaml.org/).

What's supported in the YAML is specified [here](docs/yaml.md).

## Analyzers

Analyzers are implemented to create the YAML files (e.g. from source code in a specific language, or using a specific framework).

An analyzer exists for JavaScript with support for many of the language's features.

## Processors

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@devsnicket/eunice-processors.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devsnicket/eunice-processors
) [![Git](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevSnicket/Eunice/master/docs/git.svg?sanitize=true) ![GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevSnicket/Eunice/master/docs/github.svg?sanitize=true)](https://github.com/DevSnicket/eunice-processors) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DevSnicket/eunice-processors.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DevSnicket/eunice-processors) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/DevSnicket/eunice-processors/badge.svg?branch=master&c=1)](https://coveralls.io/github/DevSnicket/eunice-processors?branch=master)

YAML files generated by analyzers can then be optionally post-processed which includes combining the output of different analyzers. A list of available processors can be found [here](https://github.com/DevSnicket/eunice-processors#processors).

Processors can be run from the command line and ([example](dogfooding/generate.sh)) from test harnesses through a [plug-in discovery](https://github.com/DevSnicket/plugin-discovery) system.

## Renderer

[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@devsnicket/eunice-renderer.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devsnicket/eunice-renderer
) [![Git](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevSnicket/Eunice/master/docs/git.svg?sanitize=true) ![GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevSnicket/Eunice/master/docs/github.svg?sanitize=true)](https://github.com/DevSnicket/eunice-renderer) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DevSnicket/eunice-renderer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DevSnicket/eunice-renderer) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/DevSnicket/eunice-renderer/badge.svg?branch=master&c=1)](https://coveralls.io/github/DevSnicket/eunice-renderer?branch=master)

To visualise and explore what's in the YAML files, and to statistically measure how well they match the intended structure, a SVG renderer has been implemented in Javascript. The renderer doesn't use lines between items to show dependencies and instead marks items with counts for each dependency type:

- matches stack (green down arrow)
- does not match stack (red up arrow) 
- is not independent (red horizontal arrow).

A full explaination of what is supported and how dependency counts are displayed can be found [here](https://github.com/DevSnicket/eunice-renderer#renderer).
