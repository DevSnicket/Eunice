Eunice End-User License Agreement ("Agreement")
Last updated: 1st September 2019

These license terms are an agreement between you and Graham Dyson. They apply to the application named Eunice ("Application"). Read the terms and conditions of this agreement carefully before using the Application. Using the Application indicates your acceptance of these license terms. If you do not accept these license terms, you should not use the Application. The terms also apply to any other method of distributing the Application.

1. Use rights.

a. The Application may be used to analyze, investigate, design, develop and test software released under Open Source Initiative (OSI) approved open source software licenses.

b. The Application may be used to analyze, investigate, design, develop and test software as part of online or in person classroom training and education, or for performing academic research.

c. Subscription. In consideration of you paying to us the Subscription Fee, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable right to access and use the Application during the Subscription Period in accordance with this Agreement. The Subscription is personal to you. You may not rent, lease, sub-license, sell, pledge, assign the benefit or delegate the burden of this Agreement or Subscription Software or hold this Agreement on trust for any other person. You shall not use the Application to manufacture or distribute a product that is substantially similar to or competitive with our software. Information on how to pay the Subscription Fee can found on the following web page http://www.devsnicket.com/eunice/licensing.

c. Evaluation. An individual can use the Application to analyze, investigate, design, develop and test software for an Evaluation Period. The Evaluation Period lasts 90 days from the first use of the Application by an individual. An individual can only commence one trail period per calendar year. You may only use the the Application for internal evaluation purposes, and only during the Evaluation Period, except for: (a) open source, (b) education purposes and (c) with a monthly Subscription as permitted above. The Evaluation Period may be extended by written agreement with us.

e. If none of the above apply, individuals, and employees and contractors of an organization may not use the the Application.

2. Licenses for third party components.

The Application includes third party components with separate legal notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in the third-party-notices.txt file accompanying the Application.

3. Scope of license.

The Application is licensed, not sold. These license terms only give you some rights to use the Application. Graham Dyson reserves all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the Application only as expressly permitted in these license terms. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the Application that only allow you to use it in certain ways. In addition, you may not:

· reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the Application, or otherwise attempt to derive the source code for the Application, except and only to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing use of certain open source components that may be included with the Application;

· remove, minimize, block or modify any notices in the Application;

· use the Application in any way that is against the law;

· share, publish, rent or lease the Application; or

· provide the Application as a stand-alone offering or combine it with any of your applications for others to use, or transfer the Application or this Agreement to any third party.

4. Support.

Because the Application is “as is”, we may not provide support services for it. If you have paid for a Subscription, support is given for the Subscription Period.

5. Disclaimer of warranty.

There is no warranty for the Application, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Except when otherwise stated in writing the copyright holders and/or other parties provide the Application “as is” without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Application is with you. Should the Application prove defective, you assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair or correction.

6. Limitation of liability.

In no event unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing will any copyright holder, or any other party who modifies and/or conveys the Application as permitted above, be liable to you for damages, including any general, special, incidental or consequential damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Application (including but not limited to loss of data or data being rendered inaccurate or losses sustained by you or third parties or a failure of the Application to operate with any other applications), even if such holder or other party has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

7. Interpretation of sections 5 and 6.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the Application, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a copy of the Application in return for a fee.

8. Modifications to Application

Graham Dyson reserves the right to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Application or any service to which it connects, with or without notice and without
liability to you.

9. Term and Termination

This Agreement shall remain in effect until terminated by you or Graham Dyson. Graham Dyson may, in their sole discretion, at any time and for any or no reason, suspend or terminate this Agreement with or without prior notice. This Agreement will terminate immediately, without prior notice from Graham Dyson, in the event that you fail to comply with any provision of this Agreement. You may also terminate this Agreement by deleting the Application and all copies thereof from your computer.

10. Amendments to this Agreement

Graham Dyson reserves the right, at their sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement at any time. If a revision is material we will provide at least 30 days notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</pre>
