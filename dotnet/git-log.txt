%as
Git log on website
publicly show development progress before first release

---
%as
dependencies don't specify type or namespace for calls within same class

---
%as
collect sequence replaced with more specific choose option

---
%as
spaces before brackets
no unnecessary brackets around discriminated union cases

---
%as
interface generic parameter constraints

---
%as
method reference instructions
e.g. calls

---
%as
field test case warning suppression

---
%as
file-system tests fail with full test case path, actual and expected

---
%as
standardised on singluar test case names

---
%as
fields of automatic events ignored

---
%as
ignore fields of automatic properties

---
%as
test case for operator overload of unary plus
readability of naming (e.g. op_UnaryPlus) could be improved

---
%as
methods no longer depend on parent class

---
%as
used expression body for test case

---
%as
indexer test case

---
%as
event items instead of add/remove methods

---
%as
property items instead of getter/setter methods

---
%as
fields

---
%as
added variables types and no duplicate types

---
%as
generic parameter constraints

---
%as
generic arguments

---
%as
teset cases for generic parameters on classes

---
%as
specified display name for tests
shorter than inferred name with namespace

---
%as
removed namespaces from test cases where irrelevant
makes visual comparison of actual and expected easier

---
%as
parameterized contructors

---
%as
base interfaces

---
%as
reordered f# files top-down
for readability and more type inference

---
%as
base classes

---
%as
parameter and return types of class and interface methods

---
%as
interface methods test case

---
%as
alphabetically ordered namespace items and delegate types

---
%as
delegate parameter types

---
%as
dependencies for return type of delegates

---
%as
namespace grouping into hierarchy of items independent of the type items contained inside
for reuse grouping dependencies into namespaces

---
%as
 yaml key/value lines mapping separated from items
doesn't require exposing of private for specific tests

---
%as
support for identifier only items move to yaml

---
%as
interface with nested class test case

---
%as
moved method and nested test cases into class directory

---
%as
methods

---
%as
moved namespace test cases into a namespace directory

---
%as
yaml tests for empty child items

---
%as
code coverage totals displayed e.g. when not 100%

---
%as
test script coverage threshold errors raised from report generator instead of altcover
altcover was only measuring statement and its branch calculation is wrong

---
%as
test results (trx) has same file name for each run

---
%as
test script generates report even when code coverage lower than threshold

---
%as
added test for interfaces

---
%as
added test for yaml empty block sequences
pattern for empty cannot to be ignored in isolation from code coverage
not including pattern and supressing F# warning still generates CIL that is detected by code coverage

---
%as
test script set to exit on error

---
%as
test for delegates

---
%as
added test for enum

---
%as
removed yaml sequence for single child items

---
%as
4 space indentation for readability

---
%as
nested classes

---
%as
moved types into namespaces and separate files

---
%as
test case for single class with no namespace

---
%as
ancestor namespaces

---
%as
parent namespace

---
%as
VS Code settings for whitespace

---
%as
deleted file that was never used

---
%as
avoided package restore error for test case projects

---
%as
namespaces as parent item
avoided type / namespace conflict of "File" between implementation and test projects
YAML serialization library no longer used as it nor an alternative has support for F# types and .NET Core

---
%as
Azure pipelines


---
%as
test script added shebang and reformatted

---
%as
single class without namespace
