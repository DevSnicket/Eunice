dependencies for return type of delegates

---
2020-05-08T19:17:34+01:00
namespace grouping into hierarchy of items independent of the type items contained inside
for reuse grouping dependencies into namespaces

---
2020-05-08T19:00:38+01:00
 yaml key/value lines mapping separated from items
doesn't require exposing of private for specific tests

---
2020-05-08T06:24:15+01:00
support for identifier only items move to yaml

---
2020-05-07T19:39:46+01:00
interface with nested class test case

---
2020-05-07T19:15:01+01:00
moved method and nested test cases into class directory

---
2020-05-07T09:22:19+01:00
methods

---

test results (trx) has same file name for each run

---
2020-05-06T09:47:34+01:00

added test for interfaces

---
2020-05-06T07:56:36+01:00

pattern for empty cannot to be ignored in isolation from code coverage
not including pattern and supressing F# warning still generates CIL that is detected by code coverage

---
2020-05-06T07:36:42+01:00
test script set to exit on error

---

avoided package restore error for test case projects

---
2020-05-02T14:34:13+01:00
namespaces as parent item
avoided type / namespace conflict of "File" between implementation and test projects
YAML serialization library no longer used as it nor an alternative has support for F# types and .NET Core

---
2020-04-30T17:36:07+01:00
Azure pipelines


---
2020-04-30T17:13:01+01:00
test script added shebang and reformatted

---
