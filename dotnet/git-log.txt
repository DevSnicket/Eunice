delegate parameter types

---
Sat May 9 06:29:24 2020 +0100
dependencies for return type of delegates

---
Fri May 8 19:17:34 2020 +0100
namespace grouping into hierarchy of items independent of the type items contained inside
for reuse grouping dependencies into namespaces

---
Fri May 8 19:00:38 2020 +0100
 yaml key/value lines mapping separated from items
doesn't require exposing of private for specific tests

---
Fri May 8 06:24:15 2020 +0100
support for identifier only items move to yaml

---
Thu May 7 19:39:46 2020 +0100

pattern for empty cannot to be ignored in isolation from code coverage
not including pattern and supressing F# warning still generates CIL that is detected by code coverage

test script set to exit on error

---
Wed May 6 07:06:47 2020 +0100

avoided package restore error for test case projects

---
Sat May 2 14:34:13 2020 +0100
namespaces as parent item
avoided type / namespace conflict of "File" between implementation and test projects
YAML serialization library no longer used as it nor an alternative has support for F# types and .NET Core

---
