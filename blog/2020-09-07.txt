writing an analyzer in Rust and a recently introduced bug
Work on what will eventually be a multi-language analyzer is progressing in Rust. I think I've got my head round most of the common ownership scenarios I'll use in Rust e.g. first-class function arguments, iterators.
I've been thinking that there are at least two categories of module analysis that will need supporting. The first is for languages that either wholly or mainly base their module system on file-system paths. The second is for languages that use namespaces and that don't use file-system paths. From my use of Rust so far, it fits into the first category, so this is what I'm implementing first.
Unfortunately, I've taken a short break from working on the new analyzer. My suspicions in recent posts about issue #155 being incomplete turned out to be more significant than I thought. Although the counts appear to be behaving correctly, I'd completely forgotten to implement the changes for the dependency list (see post image). I've created issue #164 to add this missing behavior as a top priority bug. Its likely to be very confusing, especially to new users, the opposite of the original enhancement's intent.
