first C# open source project analysed
Now that Eunice's C# analyzer is working, I thought I'd try it out on one of the most ubiquitous open source .NET packages, Newtonsoft Json.NET.
As you might have noticed from the screenshot Eunice isn't able to infer stack levels for a lot of the classes and namespaces. It has them in quite a long interdependent level. I've counted and there's almost the same amount in the lowest level of uni-directional, dependency-less items.
